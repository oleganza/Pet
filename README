Pet is an object-oriented prototype-based language optimized for developer productivity.

Language features unification principles introduced by Io and its ancestors:
- everything is an object
- object is a collection of properties
- every operation is a message
- every object may have any number of prototype objects
- no namespaces and global variables: 
- minimal syntax: JSON + messages and identifiers

Syntax:
  
  (actually, true/false/null are parsed as message sends)
  anyspace = (" " anyspace) | ""
  array = "[" anyspace 
  json  = true | false | null | number | string | array | hash
  
  
Pet syntax extension for Objective-C

  object release                 => [object release]
  array[addObject:obj atIndex:1] => [array addObject:obj atIndex:1]
  array[addObjectsFromArray:[]]  => [array addObjectsFromArray:[NSMutableArray array]]
